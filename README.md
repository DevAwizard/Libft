# Libft

## Overview

Libft is my first project as a student at 42. This project aims to build a foundational understanding of C programming by recreating standard C library functions, along with additional utility functions that could be used in future 42 projects and C programming in general. This library serves as my personal toolkit of tested and reliable functions that I can build upon as I progress through the 42 curriculum.
